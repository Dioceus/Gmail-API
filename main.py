text.append("Hi there, We are excited to contact you with an opportunity of being a possible sponsor for the inaugural Students in Engineering and Technology conference! Students in Engineering and Technology (SET) is a non-profit, student-run, organization that seeks to incite interest of engineering and technological career opportunities in youth. Our organization was founded by six students at Colonel By Secondary School, with the purpose of creating a one-day engineering conference geared towards high school students interested in pursuing engineering or other technology-related fields. Our conference will feature a series of panels, workshops, and activities to engage students in the emergence of engineering in our daily lives. Students will also have the opportunity to network with engineering students, professionals, and firms. It will be held at the Engineering Faculty at the University of Ottawa on Saturday October 20th. To improve the quality of our conference, we rely on the support of corporate sponsors such as yourself. We are seeking monetary donations to make our conference as affordable as possible, as we are trying to supply all the tools and materials participants may need for our competition. Our Sponsorship Package is attached below for more information over how your company can support us. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact our Director of Corporate Relations, David Chen, at (ottawa.set@gmail.com). You can also visit our website at http://setottawa.com/ for more information on what we do. We look forward to your reply. Sincerely, The Students in Engineering and Technology Team")
